With transactions, you can have memos or messages.
Messages are your transaction memos shown in a more friendly way. Like transactions, they can be organized as a list or as a table.
List Table If you have a contact in your address book with the matching address, Ywallet will display the contact name instead of the address.
Also, the list shows your message as a chat. However, some of the messages may not have a known sender.</description><generator>Hugo</generator><language>en-us</language><atom:link href="https://hhanh00.github.io/ywdocs/messages/index.xml" rel="self" type="application/rss+xml"/><item><title>Message Details</title><link>https://hhanh00.github.io/ywdocs/messages/details/index.html</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://hhanh00.github.io/ywdocs/messages/details/index.html</guid><description> Navigate to the previous/next message and to the previous/next message in the same thread.
