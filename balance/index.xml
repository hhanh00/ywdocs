When the wallet has up to date information, it will simply show the current block height.
But when it detects that it is behind, it will switch to &amp;ldquo;synchronization mode&amp;rdquo;.
Note Your transparent funds do not need full synchronization.
If you want to abort synchronization, simply close and rerun the app.
Synchronization Mode Synchronization mode is either &amp;ldquo;Rescan&amp;rdquo; or &amp;ldquo;Catchup&amp;rdquo;.</description></item><item><title>Addresses</title><link>https://hhanh00.github.io/ywdocs/balance/addresses/index.html</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://hhanh00.github.io/ywdocs/balance/addresses/index.html</guid><description>Unlike other cryptocurrencies, Zcash and Ycash accounts can have several addresses (with different properties).
The Zcash protocol involves a few crypto systems and addresses:
the &amp;ldquo;traditional&amp;rdquo; Bitcoin inspired addresses: transparent addresses, the shielded/private addresses. Zcash has developed and improved shielded transactions based on zero-knowledge proofs. At this point, there are three types of private systems: Sprout, Sapling, Orchard. Note Zcash started with Sprout. Then Sapling drastically improved the performance. Finally Orchard eliminated the need for a trusted setup.</description></item><item><title>Balance</title><link>https://hhanh00.github.io/ywdocs/balance/balance/index.html</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://hhanh00.github.io/ywdocs/balance/balance/index.html</guid><description>Balance in the currently selected address/pool Equivalent in fiat or Crypto reference currency , as selected in the settings, Funds available in the other pools The border is only shown when you have funds in the other pools and indicates that the balance displayed in the center is not your total balance.
