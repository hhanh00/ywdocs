It is compatible with most wallet apps, i.e. you can recover your funds using another wallet than Ywallet.
However, every account has its own seed phrase and you MUST save every seed phrase if you have multiple accounts.
Moreover, the seed phrase saves your account keys but not the synchronizationd data. After you recover, you will have to rescan the blockchain from the account height.</description></item><item><title>App Backup</title><link>https://ywallet.app/backup/app/index.html</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://ywallet.app/backup/app/index.html</guid><description>App Backup is a compressed &amp;amp; encrypted copy of the application database.
