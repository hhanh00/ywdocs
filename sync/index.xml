After installation, the wallet starts with no data from the blockchain/network.
Synchronization is the process by which the wallet gets the transaction data and updates its database.
There are two types of information:
accounts and keys: only you should know that. synchronization data: derived from the keys and the blockchain data. Light wallets The blockchain has hundreds of GB of data. It contains all the transactions of every user. Therefore it will keep growing larger and larger.</description><generator>Hugo</generator><language>en-us</language><atom:link href="https://ywallet.app/sync/index.xml" rel="self" type="application/rss+xml"/><item><title>Rescan</title><link>https://ywallet.app/sync/rescan/index.html</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://ywallet.app/sync/rescan/index.html</guid><description>Use Rescan when you want to reset all your accounts and scan the blockchain data from a given point in time / height.
This is particularly useful if you have an issue with your wallet and want to reset it, but also when you import an old account and want to recover its balance.
The synchronization data is deleted but your accounts are kept. Then the wallet starts downloading and scanning blocks from the given height.</description></item><item><title>Rewind</title><link>https://ywallet.app/sync/rewind/index.html</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://ywallet.app/sync/rewind/index.html</guid><description>Use Rewind when you want to rollback the synchronization data to a previous point and then make the wallet catch up from there.
Rewinding deletes the synchronization data after the given date/height.
This is useful if you notice an anomaly with your wallet that happened after a certain height. If you think your wallet was OK prior to that point, you can try rewinding to it and see if your issue is resolved.</description></item></channel></rss>
