This is particularly useful if you have an issue with your wallet and want to reset it.
The synchronization data is deleted but your accounts are kept. Then the wallet starts downloading and scanning blocks from the given height.
If you have multiple accounts, make sure you enter a height that is lower than the height of the first transaction (in every account).</description></item><item><title>Rewind</title><link>https://hhanh00.github.io/ywdocs/sync/rewind/index.html</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://hhanh00.github.io/ywdocs/sync/rewind/index.html</guid><description>Use Rewind when you want to rollback the synchronization data to a previous point and then let it catch up from there.
Rewinding deletes the synchronization data after the given date/height.
This is useful if you notice an anomaly with your wallet that happened after a certain height. If you think your wallet was OK prior to that point, you can try rewinding to it and see if your issue is resolved.</description></item></channel></rss>
