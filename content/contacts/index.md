Saving your contacts to the blockchain
makes a special self-transaction that
contains your unsaved contacts. 
You only have to pay the miner's fee.

When a wallet is restored, the contacts
are reloaded along with the balance.

If you store a unified address, the wallet
will recognize a transaction made to
any of its receivers.
